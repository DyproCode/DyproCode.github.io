        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="textBubble">
          <p>Hi!</p>
          <p>My name is Dylan Proctor and I am a software developer. I graduated Fanshawe College in 2025 with honors. In my free time, I love to travel, go for hikes, read, program and play card games.
             I grew up living all over Canada, I've lived in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland.
          </p>
          <p>
            While completing my education I was able to work in 2 software developer roles. Not only did I do all 3 CO-OPs, I also worked part-time during my 4th term with
            the Government of Canada and I worked my 5th and 6th term with Info-Tech. My first role was working for the Government of Canada.
            In this role I wrote new VBA macros as well as refactor old macros. I was able to work back and forth with the people who use the macros and take in their feedback to
            improve the macros. I was also responsible for translating some of the macros from English to French. One of the things I am proud of while working there was finding solutions
            for steamlining the translation process by having common translations in text files and using those to translate the macros instead of manually doing it like it was being done before.
            My next work opportunity was with Info-Tech Research Group. While working there I helped build web applications for HR teams to conduct surveys. While working at ITRG, I became deeply
            familiar with Agile, Scrum and Jira. Info-Tech uses Ruby on Rails to build their web apps and I grew to love the framework over time. The thing I am the most proud of working at ITRG was
            being able to participate and feel like I was part of the team despite being just a CO-OP or a part-time employee. By the end of my second CO-OP I was presenting what my team was doing to
            other teams as well as being involved with the architecture of our new project.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I love to explore new technologies as well as build simple tools for myself. I have also done a lot of research on game design and game software. Currently, I am really
            interested in agentic AI and have been learning and exploring all the different uses for it. In the past, I enjoyed trying to replicate games I like using the Godot engine and C#. I am
            generally a vary curious person who loves to learn new things and try to apply them in my every day life. I also really like trying to find ways to do things more efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thats a little bit about me, if you are interested in getting in touch, feel free to reach out!
